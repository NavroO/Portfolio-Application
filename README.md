# Portfolio Application

This is my first portfolio application. The idea for this application came about when I was reading a book about basics of Java and started learning JavaFX. This application has access to all my projects (To my entire portfolio). I haven't transferred my portfolio to the browser because I haven't mastered Spring Boot yet.
